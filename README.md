Peer Assessments for Getting and Cleaning Data Project in Coursera

This repo have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. 

Please download the Samsung data and put the whole file 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your current workspace directory. 

The output of this R code will output the tidy dataset as the csv format. You can open this file in the Excel. 

If you have any question about the code 'run_analysis.R', please contact me. My email is jshj250@163.com. I'm glad to receive your letter.
